# Magento Dummy Installers

Integrate with http://api.randomuser.me/

Scripts to easily create a category tree and some dummy products in Magento.
Although well tested on several production projects please be careful that this
is still in BETA.

For the category importer tree file make sure the Root category already exists 
and the names in Magento and the file match

Roadmap:
- Create a Magento extension out of the loose importer files
- Add attribute options to the category import
- Add configurable, bundled and grouped products to the dummy products
